# simple-image-viewer
The simple-image-viewer is a Ubuntu Linux graphical application to display an image or images, written in Python using the PyCharm IDE.  Some check in files are specific to the PyCharm IDE.

The app can currently open all images in a selectable folder and also has some zoom in/zoom out capabilities.  

The application uses TKinter and PIL/Pillow libraries for widgets and image manipulation.
